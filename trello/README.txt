Bugs/Concerns: Many of my issues revolved around indexing. I aligned most of my indecies to match with the desired location in data but this was difficult - sometimes errors occur due to array indecies being out of bounds or referencing the wrong location in memory. Also, the description cannot edit HTML tags as Vue (without components) cannot parse raw HTML - I tried to find a work around but was not successful. Additionally, you have to  chick again to orient list items after adding items. This also had some indexing problems. Finally, I was not able to include the full functionality while using Firebase. I was able to do this with JSON but the integration with firebase limited some functionality as I was not as easily able to edit/update content. Additionally, using Vue produced some flags in the validation, which could not be corrected. I did validate my code but some errors could not be fixed due to the use of Vue. My cards are only added to the first list. 

Extra Credit features: My three challenge features are: "switch between viewing project lists horizontally or vertically", "make any number comments on a card", "assign any number of users to a card".

Description: This is a mock trello board that allows you to work with lists, view/create/expand cards, creates users, customize project landscapes, and edit all of these functions. It uses a JSON data structure that is backed and housed by Firebase.

Impression: This assignment was incredibly time consuming. I did not completely track my hours but I probably spent 50-60 hours on this project. I did not have a strong foundational understanding of Vue or Firebase from lecture. I had to supplement the lecture with a lot of outside resources. Additionally, this project required a lot of functionality. There were about 40 requirements that the website needed to do, each one requiring data/methods/and thought. This assignment required knowledge of Vue, Firebase, and HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It was a very difficult and very time consuming lab. However, it was very rewarding to build such a large project and see the funcitonality of the site coming together.
